tell which date is later

check leap_year and set leap_yearFlag

    } 

about older date
toEndMonth_o = calculate days till end of the month
    check leap_year if the month was February

fromEndMonth2endYear_o = calculate days between end of the month and end of the year.
    check leap_year if the month was January (contain February)

about later date
fromStartMonth_l = calculate days since beggining of the month
fromStartYear2endMonth_l = calculate days between beggining of the year and beggining of the month.  
 check leap_year if the month was March or later (contain February)

calc yearses days between
later_year - older_year = years_gap
loop from later_year + 1 to older_year -1
gap_years_days = count days of years_gap  

gap_days = gap_years_days + toEndMonth_o + fromEndMonth2endYear_o + fromStartMonth_l + fromStartYear2endMonth_l
